# Todo Summary Assistant

This is a full-stack web application that lets users manage their personal to-do items and generate a summarized overview of pending tasks. The summary is created using a real language model API and can be sent directly to a Slack channel.

---

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete to-do items.
- View the current list of to-dos.
- Generate a meaningful summary of all pending to-dos using an LLM (language model).
- Send the summary to a Slack channel via webhook.
- Display success or error messages for Slack integration.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **LLM API:** Cohere AI
- **Slack Integration:** Incoming Webhooks

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed (v14 or higher recommended)
- A Supabase account with a project created
- Cohere API key (free tier available)
- Slack workspace with an Incoming Webhook URL

---

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/todo-summary-assistant.git
   cd todo-summary-assistant
````

2. **Create a `.env` file:**

   Use the `.env.example` file as a template and add your own keys.

   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=your_slack_webhook_url
   PORT=5000
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies and start the server:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Install frontend dependencies and start the React app:**

   Open a new terminal window/tab:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## How to Configure Slack Webhook

* Go to your Slack workspace
* Create a new **Incoming Webhook** integration here:
  [https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)
* Select the channel where you want to post the summary
* Copy the generated Webhook URL and add it to your `.env` file as `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`

---

## How to Get Cohere API Key

* Sign up for a free account at [https://cohere.ai](https://cohere.ai)
* Navigate to the API section
* Generate a new API key
* Add it to your `.env` file as `COHERE_API_KEY`

---

## Design & Architecture

* The **backend** is built with Express.js and handles CRUD operations for todos using Supabase as the database.
* The **summarize** endpoint collects all pending todos, sends them to Cohere's language model for summarization, then posts the summary to Slack using the webhook URL.
* The **frontend** uses React for an interactive UI where users can manage todos and trigger the summary process.
* Error handling is implemented to notify the user if the Slack message fails or if any API call is unsuccessful.

---

## Optional Deployment

You can deploy the frontend on platforms like Vercel or Netlify. The backend can be hosted on platforms supporting Node.js like Heroku, Render, or Supabase Edge Functions.

---

## Notes

* All environment variables are kept secure in the `.env` file and are not committed to the repository.
* This project uses free-tier services wherever possible.
* Please ensure you do not expose your API keys publicly.
